# STM32F411 Timer–ADC–DMA–UART Firmware

## Overview
This repository contains my implementation of the STM32 Blackpill assignment involving periodic ADC sampling with DMA and UART transmission.  

The focus of this project is on **peripheral configuration, integration, and firmware build** using STM32CubeMX and GCC ARM toolchain. The MCU initialization code was generated by CubeMX, while the firmware logic and build process were manually handled.

## Assignment Requirements
The assignment required the following:

1. Configure a 100 Hz timer  
2. Trigger ADC conversion on timer overflow  
3. Transfer ADC results using DMA  
4. On DMA completion, send results via UART  
5. Display results on a serial terminal (PuTTY)

## What I Implemented
The following steps were completed:

1. **RCC and Clock Configuration:** Configured system clock and peripheral clocks using CubeMX  
2. **Timer:** Configured a 100 Hz timer to generate trigger events for ADC conversion  
3. **ADC + DMA:** Configured ADC pin(s) and DMA to transfer conversion results to memory without CPU intervention  
4. **UART:** Configured UART for serial transmission of ADC results  
5. **Code Generation:** Generated CubeMX initialization and HAL code
7. **Firmware Build:** Built the project manually using the command prompt with `make` and GCC ARM toolchain, producing `.elf` and object files  
8. **Debugging:** Resolved minor compiler/HAL issues such as `readonly` keyword conflicts and compiler-specific adjustments  

**Note:** No interaction with PuTTY or UART output verification was performed due to missing USB-UART bridge and ST-Link/VCP detection issues.

## Tools and Environment
- **STM32CubeMX** –   Peripheral configuration and code generation  
- **GCC ARM (arm-none-eabi-gcc)** – Command-line firmware compilation  
- **Makefile** – Build system  
- **STM32CubeProgrammer** – ST-Link detection and flashing attempts  
- **ST-Link v2 (clone)** – Debug interface  
- **PuTTY** – Intended serial terminal (installed but not used) 
- **VS Code** – Edited main.c, linker scripts, Makefile, and other project files 
- **Command Prompt** – Ran "make" to build firmware
